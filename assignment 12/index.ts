// 12.	Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
// The text of each message should be the same, 
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



var names=["farhad","yasir","obaid","hassan"];
var i=0;
for(i=0; i<names.length; i++){
    console.log(`hi ${names[i]}, you are invited on dinner.`);
}
